## Let's play!

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

* :fist: rock destroys scissors.
* :v: scissors cut paper.
* :hand: paper covers rock.
* :neutral_face: if thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Good luck! :wink:
